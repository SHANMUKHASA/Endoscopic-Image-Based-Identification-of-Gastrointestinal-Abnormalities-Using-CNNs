# Endoscopic Image-Based Identification of Gastrointestinal Abnormalities Using CNNs

This MATLAB project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to endoscopic images for identifying gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities like ulcers, inflammation, and tumors.

---

## 🧠 Project Summary

Endoscopic imaging is crucial in early detection of GI diseases. This project automates the identification process using a CNN-based approach built in MATLAB, making diagnosis faster and more efficient.
